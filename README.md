# Deeplearning

This is the record of learning deeplearning from the course of "小土堆"  in https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hE411t7RN

Codes and data are here, with annotations.

The best way of learning is just run one, and make the best use of the formal docs and LLM models.

Update: adding one folder named Deeplearning form Scratch, which contains codes of the book “Python 深度学习入门”
